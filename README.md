# Budget-Guard
Budgeting App Project

This is a Javascript "Budgeting App" that I am working on as part of "The Complete JavaScript Course 2019: Build Real Projects!" Udemy course. 

The course starts us off with some bare bone essentials such as the HTML page and styling.  All the Javascript is taught by the instructor and coded by myself.  

Goals of this project:
  Continued learning of Javascript language
  Code architecture and how good architecture makes for a better app 
  DOM manipulation and seperation of responsibities, "DOM controller" & "Data controller"
